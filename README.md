This repository contains a project that I developed for a final presentation to finish my degree as a full stack developer at [Careeria](https://careeria.fi/) (Sept 2022).

The [video](https://pixabay.com/videos/bokeh-green-background-blur-lights-5243/) playing in the background of the landing component must be credited to Tomislav Jakupec. In the same way, the still [image](https://pixabay.com/photos/frosted-glass-background-psychedelic-2360088/) in the other components must be credited to Davie Bicker.

Many thanks to Jakupec and Bicker for their works.

Also many thanks to [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) for hosting and providing open source materials.
